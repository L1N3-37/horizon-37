        <h2>Configuring a Cisco Catalyst 2960G</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my studies for the Cisco Networking Academy program, I
            completed a project that involved configuring a Cisco Catalyst 2960G
            switch. In this project I bought a physical Cisco switch along with
            a console cable and set up VLANs. I also configured telnet for
            remote access.
