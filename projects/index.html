        <h2>Configuring a Cisco Catalyst 2960G</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my studies for the Cisco Networking Academy program, I
            <br />
            completed a project that involved configuring a Cisco Catalyst 2960G
            <br />
            switch. In this project I bought a physical Cisco <br />
            switch along with a console cable and set up VLANs. I also <br />
            configured telnet for remote access. <br />
